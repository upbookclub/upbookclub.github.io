# Introduction
Welcome to Urban Perspective. We are a community driven book club where you get to share your reading experience with other passionate readers like yourself.

When you've found a book you quite enjoyed, **sharing your experience** feels very nice. We like to have such moments. Every month. We meet on the second Saturday of every month. You can join our whatsapp group link [here](https://chat.whatsapp.com/EdMSghjMusjA2OIGlXnV7Z).

# Urban Perspective Website
Well, some random dude challenged us(the Librarian ;) ) to come up with a fun and nerdy way to run a community website, so here we are. 

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the amazing [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](). You can find the source files at [upbookclub.github.io](https://github.com/upbookclub/upbookclub.github.io).

You do not need to know HTML or any programming language to be able to contribute. However, you do need to know a little bit of how [GitHub](www.github.com) works.

# Contributing

## Non Developer

1. Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).  
2. Fork our [repository](https://github.com/upbookclub/upbookclub.github.io)  
3. Using your browser, navigate to `/_data/authors.yml/`. Edit that file by adding your details(Instructions are written). Create a Pull Request.  
4. Using your browser, navigate to '/_post'. Create your new post here. Note the post should follow the following format: `YY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`. Create a Pull Request for your post.

Once your Pull Request has been resolved, your post will appear on the website.

## Developer

1. Ensure you have `ruby` and `rubygems` installed in your system.  
2. Install `jekyll` by running   
```
gem install jekyll
```
3. Fork/ Clone our [repository](https://github.com/upbookclub/upbookclub.github.io)  
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll server` to spin-up your site. Visit `http://localhost:4000/` on your browser to see the site.  

# Blog Workflow
If you're interested in writing a blog post for the website, you need to:  
1. [Fork](https://github.com/upbookclub/upbookclub.github.io#fork-destination-box) the *upbookclub.github.io* repository.  
2. Create an Author's entry in the /_data/authors.yml directory which contains your details.  
3. Write a blog post using Markdown in the `content` directory  
4. Make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) against the `master` branch  

Have fun
